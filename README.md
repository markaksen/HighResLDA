# HighResLDA

In this project, we implement a weighting scheme for a LDA-based topic model applied to scientific articles. This is joint work by Viren Bajaj and Mark Aksen as part of the Foundations of Graphical Models course at Columbia University in Fall 2020.

The dataset used was the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC) available here: https://github.com/allenai/s2orc/
